Biography
======

I am an *Assistant Professor* of the Microelectronics Thrust at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Prior to joining HKUST(GZ), I held the position of Principal Engineer at Hisilicon, HUAWEI, where I worked on accelerator design for the next-generation DPU. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) in 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/) and collaborated closely with [Prof. Weng-Fai WONG](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongwf/) and [Prof. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/).



<!-- In particular, I am interested in exploring algorithm-hardware codesigned accelerators (on FPGAs or for RISCVs), as well as optimizing heterogeneous computing systems that feature FPGA, GPU, or NPU resources, for emerging applications such as graph processing, database systems, machine learning, and autonomous driving systems. 
, and I attained my B.Eng. in Microelectronic Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2016
-->

My research aims to build sustainable computing solutions employing *hardware acceleration* and *system optimization*. 

In particular, I am interested in investigating algorithm-hardware codesigned accelerators, which can be implemented on FPGAs or integrated with RISCVs, for data processing such as graph analytics, databases, and machine learning. 
In addition, I am interested in redesigning the system stack for heterogeneous computing environments that feature diverse computing resources (e.g., CPUs, FPGAs, GPUs, and NPUs) and new interconnects (e.g., CXL).


Openings
======

***I am actively looking for self-motivated PhD students, master students, and research assistants for the intake in 2024 spring/fall. 
Please feel free to email me your CV if you are interested in my research.***
