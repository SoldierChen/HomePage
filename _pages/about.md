Shixuan Sun is currently a Research Fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by [Dr. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/).
His research interests are in database systems, graph algorithms, and parallel computing. Current focus is on acceleration for graph queries, and graph-based fraud detection.
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020,
supervised by [Dr. Qiong Luo](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~luo/). During 2014 to 2015, he worked as a Software Developer Engineer at Microsoft (Shanghai) from 2014 to 2015.
Prior to that, he got his M.S and B.S. in Computer Sciences from the School of Software Engineering, Tongji University in 2014 and 2011 respectively.
